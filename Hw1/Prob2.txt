A natural way to get started thinking about this problem is to
assume the claim is false and try to work toward obtaining a contradiction.
What would it mean for the claim to be false? There would exist some stable
matching M in which a good man m was married to a bad woman w.
Now, let’s consider what the other pairs in M look like. There are k good
men and k good women. Could it be the case that every good woman is married
to a good man in this matching M? No: one of the good men (namely, m) is
already married to a bad woman, and that leaves only k − 1 other good men.
So even if all of them were married to good women, that would still leave some
good woman who is married to a bad man.
Let w' be such a good woman, who is married to a bad man. It is now
easy to identify an instability in M: consider the pair (m, w' ). Each is good,
but is married to a bad partner. Thus, each of m and w' prefers the other to
their current partner, and hence (m, w') is an instability. This contradicts our
assumption that M is stable, and hence concludes the proof.
