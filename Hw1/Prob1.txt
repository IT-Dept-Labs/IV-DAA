i)		False.  Consider the group m1, m2, w1, and w2.  

		m1 has the ranking:
		1. w1
		2. w2

		m2 has the ranking:
		1. w2
		2. w1

		w1 has the ranking:
		1. m2
		2. m1

		w2 has the ranking:
		1. m1
		2. m2

		In this situation, it's impossible to have a pair (m, w), let alone a stable matching containing a pair, such that m is ranked first on the preference list of w and w is ranked first on the preference list of m.  

		Consider each m, m1 and m2:

		If m1 were in a pair with the w ranked first on the preference list of m1, then m1 would be in a pair with w1.  However, then w1 would not be in a pair with m2, whom is ranked first on w1's preference list of m.

		If m2 were in a pair with the w ranked first on the preference list of m2, then m2 would be in a pair with w2.  However, then w2 would not be in a pair with m1, whom is ranked first on w2's preference list.

		Therefore, in this instance, it cannot be the case that either m, m1 or m2, can be paired with the w ranked first on its preference list and have its "match", w, be with the m that is ranked first on its preference list.  Therefore, since there is no way to include m in such a pair (m, w) such that m is ranked first on the preference list of w and w is ranked first on the preference list of m, there cannot be a stable matching containing a pair (m, w) such that m is ranked first on the preference list of w and w is ranked first on the preference list of m.
