Q: Design a linear time algorithm which, given an undirected graph G
 and a particular edge e in it,determines whether G has cycle containing e

 A: Let e = (u,v). The graph has a cycle containing e if and only if u and v are in the same connected
component in the graph obtained by deleting e. This can be easily checked by a DFS on this graph.
